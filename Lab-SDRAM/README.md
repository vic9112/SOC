# SDRAM with prefetch buffer

- Because applying our implemented prefetch buffer to just one matrix multiplication doesn't allow us to fully showcase the advantages of our prefetch buffer,
- we are only providing changes to the linker and the remapping part here.
- Please refer to the 'FinalProject' repositories for the added prefetch buffer.
